        <h1>The nitrogen value of your soil is low </h1>
        <h2>Please consider the following suggestions.</h2>
        <p>1. Use chemical fertilizers like ammonium nitrate or urea, which provide a quick boost of nitrogen. Organic
            options include blood meal, fish emulsion, or feather meal. Be sure to follow application rates and timing
            specific to your crops to avoid over-fertilization.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>2. Planting legumes (like clover, peas, or beans) can enhance soil nitrogen through their symbiotic
            relationship with nitrogen-fixing bacteria. These plants absorb atmospheric nitrogen and convert it into a
            form usable by other plants. After harvest, incorporate the legume biomass into the soil to release the
            nitrogen.</p>
        <br>
        <p>3. Grow cover crops such as rye, vetch, or turnips during off-seasons. These crops can help build soil
            nitrogen levels, especially when they are tilled back into the soil as green manure. They also improve soil
            structure and organic matter</p>
        <br> 
        <p>4. Regularly add compost or well-rotted manure to your soil. These materials decompose and release nitrogen
            slowly over time, improving soil fertility and structure. Organic matter also supports microbial activity,
            which can further enhance nitrogen availability.</p>
